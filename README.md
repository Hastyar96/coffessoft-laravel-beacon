# Laravel Beacon v5.0

**AI Development Copilot for Laravel** — Scan, understand, analyze, and improve any Laravel project.

Transform static project analysis into actionable AI context. Beacon helps AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Cline, Copilot) understand a Laravel project almost as if they had been developed together with the original team from day one.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
composer require coffesoft/laravel-beacon

# Full project scan (recommended first step)
php artisan beacon:scan

# Generate task-specific AI context
php artisan beacon:task "Create attendance system"

# Code quality review
php artisan beacon:review --min-severity=warning

# AI-powered refactoring plan
php artisan beacon:fix-plan
```

The service provider auto-discovers via Laravel package discovery.

## Architecture

```
25 Scanners → Raw Data → 35 Intelligence Engines → 15+ Output Files

v2 Scanners (25):
  Models, Controllers, Routes, Migrations, Database, Config,
  Services, Repositories, FormRequests, Middleware, Policies,
  Events, Jobs, Notifications, Mail, Traits, Enums, Helpers,
  Livewire, Blade, API, Queue, Storage, Packages, Commands

v2-v4 Intelligence (30 engines):
  Architecture Detection, Security Analysis, Performance Analysis,
  Business Rules, Relationship Graph, AI Summaries,
  Database Intelligence, Route Intelligence, Folder Tree,
  Workflow Detection, Dependency Graph, Feature Map,
  Impact Map, AI Context Compression, Entry Points,
  Developer Onboarding, AI Prompt Pack,
  Knowledge Graph, Semantic Index, Search Index,
  Architecture Knowledge, Feature Stories,
  Task Context, Diff Engine, Review Engine,
  Enhanced Statistics, AI Summary, AI Navigation

v5.0 AI Copilot (5 NEW engines):
  AutoControllerSplitter — Detects controllers with >10 methods
  CodeFixEngine — Actionable patch suggestions (read-only)
  RouteHealthEngine — Orphan/duplicate/unnamed route detection
  ModelDependencyTracker++ — Coupling heatmap per model
  AiRefactorPlanner — 3-phase prioritized execution plan
```

## Safety

- **Read-only** — Never executes or modifies application code
- **AST-first** — Uses PHP tokenization for safe analysis
- **Zero application boot** — No database queries, no service registration
- **Confidence scores** — Every finding includes 0–100 reliability rating
- **Evidence field** — Every suggestion includes the data that triggered it
